# About
This is a manual test application for testing the KW2xrf network device driver.

The kw2xrf radio-module is integrated in the same package with the CPU,
therefore no external pin configuration except the common clock and
power circuit is neccessary.

# Usage
For testing the KW2xrf driver you can use the netif shell commands that are
included in this application.
